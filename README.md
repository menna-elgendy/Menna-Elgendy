Final Project
Checkers with A.I.


1.	 Description of the project:

The aim of this project is to code a Checkers game where the player will be able to play against the computer. It is played on an 8×8 checkered board with twelve pieces per side. This code should allow the computer to be intelligent enough to win the other player. 

2. Libraries that will be used:

•	PyGame
•	random
•	Tkinter

3. Features of the game:

A start menu gives the player two choices, either two players or one player. 


4. Description of the user interface:

The game will be implemented on PyGame and the user will be able to move his pieces on the game board using the mouse buttons, provided he follows the rules of checkers game. If an invalid move was made, the piece won’t move. 

5. Demo by 13th of November:

My target is to code the game board and the two players option by that date, no A.I. will be implemented at that point.
